Updates: 
 - Moved the source for the java code, gae code and tests to the correct maven format (src/main/java, src/main/test)
 - Updated unit tests to read the test data files from the classpath 
 - moved tests/gae code under main repo

TODO:
 - fix the svn format. Right now the main code is not under trunk :(
